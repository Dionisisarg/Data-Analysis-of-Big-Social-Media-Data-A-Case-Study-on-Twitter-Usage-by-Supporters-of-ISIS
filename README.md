# Data-Analysis-of-Big-Social-Media-Data-A-Case-Study-on-Twitter-Usage-by-Supporters-of-ISIS
This dissertation includes an approach to the process of analyzing large volumes of data in social media, specifically focusing on Twitter. Subsequently, an analysis of a dataset  under study is conducted, which contains all the tweets from supporters of Isis extremists, and significant knowledge is extracted from it through appropriate algorithms.

After the workspace environment has been prepared, the introductory code (data(1)) is written to load the necessary libraries 
and read the data file. (Figure 1.1) is the result of executing the command "data.info()" in the code (data(1))."

One of the most valuable conclusions that can be drawn from the dataset studied in this thesis is languages chosen by extremists
to generate content in their attempt to approach a new audience and spread their ideas. Algorithm (language(2)). The execution 
of the algorithm returns as a result languages used by extremists in their tweets as well as usage metrics of these languages. 
(Figure 2.1, 2.2).

The most significant conclusion that can be drawn from the dataset studied in the context of this thesis is the visualization 
of words that appear most frequently in the file. For this purpose, the Word Cloud tool is utilized, which visualizes words of
a text in a manner where the most frequently used words appear larger in font size. The algorithm used is (WordCloud(3)), and 
the result of this algorithm is represented by (Figure 3.1). Another conclusion that can be drawn from the same algorithm is 
topics discussed by the 10 most active users of the ISIS network on Twitter. Initially, the 10 most 'sensitive' topics that 
Twitter users engage with are displayed (Figure 3.2) Subsequently, after these topics have been displayed, a chart is created 
illustrating the 10 most active users and the topics each user is primarily engaged with. (Figure 3.3).

The following is the algorithm for visualizing published tweets over a period of time, (visualization of tweets over a period of time(4))
and its results are Figures (4.1, 4.2, and 4.3). Finally the preceding algorithm also displays which day of the week do 
Isis supporters post more tweets (Figure 4.4).


An important piece of information that emerges from the algorithm (analysis users of twitter(5)) is the total number of tweets contained 
within the processed file, as well as the count of unique tweets within that file (Figure 5.1 and 5.2). Subsequently, the 
algorithm presents the 5 most frequent users characterized as senders and the 5 most frequent users referred to as receivers. 
Senders are users who create tweets and use "@" to mention other users. Receivers are users with the greatest influence, 
receiving the most mentions of their names from other users (Figure 5.3). Additionally, regarding the Receivers, there is 
also a reference to their descriptions, so it can be perceived that they are mostly "impartial" news websites (Figure 5.4). 
Finally, there is a mapping of the "most tweeted" into a graph. Users have been categorized into three groups:
1. Only senders-red
2. Only receivers-blue
3. Senders and receivers-green

The next step involves mapping the edges between nodes where users have tweeted among themselves. The thickness of the edge 
indicates how many communications have been made. The weight indicates the number of tweets sent between two connected users (Figure 5.5).

Before executing the algorithm (most common words(6)), which will calculate the words with the highest frequency of occurrence, 
preprocessing is required on the dataset.

To begin with, it is necessary to convert all characters of the tweets to lowercase, remove words such as "in" and "the," and 
perform  stemming on the words, which involves generating morphological variations of a root/base word. For example, the word 
"like" might include variations such as "likes," "liked," "likely," and "liking." Additionally, an attempt will be made to 
separate hashtags into individual words wherever possible. In the first figure (Figure 6.1), there is a chart displaying the 20
most common words used by supporters of ISIS in the tweets they publish. The next step involves the analysis of the location 
from which the studied tweets are being published. An analysis was conducted on the "location" column of the tweets.csv file, 
tallying the frequency of each location's appearance in the tweets. The resulting data is depicted in (Figures 6.2 and 6.3).
The analysis of the tweet topics using Part-Of-Speech (POS) tagging follows. It reveals that there are 28,589 distinct and 
unique topics for study (Figure 6.4). Finally, from the previously displayed results, the top 20 are selected, and a chart is 
created depicting the topics of the tweets along with their frequencies of occurrence (Figure 6.5).

The first chart generated by the algorithm (time series analysis of tweets per day(7)) is a graph where the y-axis represents 
the number of tweets published, and the x-axis represents the time period from 01/01/2016 to 13/05/2016 (Figure 7.1).
The chart in (Figure 7.2) is a graph illustrating the frequency of tweets published from January 2016 to May of the same year.
Furthermore, it shows the frequency of tweets per day with the gray graphical representation, while simultaneously presenting the 
frequency of tweets per 7 days using the red color. Finally, two milestones for the Isis supporter community are also indicated on 
this graph, such as the bombing attack in Brussels on March 22, 2016, and the bombing attack in Yemen in 2016.

The algorithm (user analysis and time analysis of tweets (8)) initially displays a chart showing the top 10 most active users on 
Twitter in the network of ISIS supporters (Figure 8.1). Next, the second chart displayed illustrates the number of tweets published 
during the time period from October 2015 to April 2016 (Figure 8.2).Finally, the next chart (Figure 8.3) also illustrates the 
relationship between the published tweets and the time period from October 2015 to April 2016.

At the beginning of the algorithm (draw network (9)), a DataFrame is created containing the information of individual tagging 
activities in each row. This includes all those activities where the special symbol "@" is used, through which a user of the Isis 
network references another user. Next, a similar DataFrame is created containing only the interaction among users of this particular 
DataFrame. This new DataFrame has 6 columns and 11,966 rows. The columns are as follows: User, Mentions, Time, User_numberstatuses, 
User_followers, and Weight (Figure 9.1). Finally, it is useful and quite important to produce knowledge of how many times a user in 
the Isis Twitter network is mentioned by other users and how often reference to others. Similarly, for the second DataFrame, which 
includes all users and the users they are mentioned by (users with "@" before their names), it is important to identify the most 
active user and the most mentioned user within the network (Figure 9.2).

The first result displayed by the (n-gramms(10)) algorithm is the 20 most common words found within the tweets.csv file.
To achieve this first result, all stopwords have been removed (Figure 10.1). Another important conclusion that can be drawn from the
above algorithm is the usernames that appear most frequently within the analyzed file (Figure 10.2). Another important conclusion 
that can be drawn from the above algorithm is the most frequent hashtags used by supporters of Isis in their tweets (Figure 10.3).
And finally, one more important conclusion that can be derived from the above algorithm is the most frequent urls (addresses
internet) used by Isis supporters in their tweets (Figure 10.4).

The first diagram generated by the (useful algorithms (11)) is titled "Number of tweets trend by dates," which shows the number of 
tweets posted per month from January 2015 to May 2016 (Figure 11.1). The second diagram generated is in the form of a histogram. It 
shows the number of tweets posted every two months (Figure 11.2). The third diagram generated  titled "Most number of tweets in a 
day," which shows the top 10 days with the highest number of tweets published per day (Figure 11.3). The fourth diagram titled 
"Most number of tweets by user" and shows the top 10 users from the Isis network on Twitter with the highest number of published 
posts (Figure 11.4). The fifth diagram titled "Most followed user" displays the users with the most followers in the Isis network 
on Twitter (Figure 11.5). The sixth diagram titled "Most number of hashtags used" shows how often some specific expressions are 
used by supporters of Isis, where they precede these expressions with the # symbol to give greater emphasis to their statements 
(Figure 11.6). An important piece of information that can be extracted from the above algorithm is the number of data points present
in each column (Figure 11.7). Finally, the following diagram contains the number of statuses and the number of followers (Figure 11.8).
